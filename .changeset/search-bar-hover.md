SearchBar now has a hover state, as the design guideline asks. Pointing at the bar's input container turns its border from `otl-gray-200` to `otl-gray-300`, in every size and in both themes, so pointer users get feedback before they click. It's a semantic token, so it re-themes in dark. Focus still wins: a bar whose input has focus keeps its `otl-primary-300` border and ring while hovered. Nothing else changes on hover, and SearchBar's props are the same. A `hover:` border class you added to the bar yourself can go. `full.css` in `@amerfathullah/myds-style` carries the new class.
